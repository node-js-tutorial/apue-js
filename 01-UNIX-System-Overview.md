# UNIX System Overview

## Introduction

Actually, the Operating System (or OS) is a program that runs programs. For example, some people like play games like the PUBG, We all know that this game is essentially a program, so you may need a palce to run this game program, such as a xbox, PC even a mobile phone. So there are different operating systems support you to run this game with different experience by gamepad, keyboard & mouse or a touch screen. The focus of this text is to describe that OS is a program that provide various basic services and ability to run programs.

As web browsers' user, you may wanna ask if the  browser is OS or not. Well, let see, you could tweets with both Twitter.com (on browsers) and it's App (on Android, iOS or  other operating systems), it seems like the browser is on the same level  like OS.

However, browser is not OS. Cause a web browser never has ability for websites to directly interact with hardware. The OS, as software, provide more basic functions, such as reading or  writting files on your hard disk, controlling peripherals   devices like a keyboard, and allowing your programs to understand what you want when you press the keyboard, click the mouse or tap the touchscreen. Well, what if we provide these basic functions to a browser? Does it become OS?
